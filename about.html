          <h2>Abisko's Flora and Fauna</h2>
          <p>Abisko National Park is home to a diverse array of wildlife and plant life, set against a unique geological backdrop. Predators like bears, wolverines, and lynx roam the park, though they are elusive, leaving tracks visible in the winter snow. Moose are common in winter due to the relatively shallow snow, and reindeer can be spotted year-round. Birdlife is abundant, with golden eagles, white-tailed eagles, and other raptors soaring above, while various songbirds and wading birds inhabit the birch forests, alpine heaths, and marshlands.</p>
          <p>The park's rich flore thrives in areas like Mount Njulla, known as "the flower mountain" for its diverse alpine plants, supported by limestone-rich soil and favorable sun exposure. Geologically, Abisko is defined by its mountain bedrock and dramatic landscapes shaped by ancient ice sheets, with the Abiskojakka river carving through the valley and forming steep canyon walls of schist and dolomite limestone.</p>
        
          <h3>What type of ecosystem(s) is found within this protected area?</h3>
