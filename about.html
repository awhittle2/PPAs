          <p>Abisko National Park is located in <strong>Norrbotten County, Sweden</strong>, near the Norwegian border and within the <strong>Arctic Circle</strong>. Its unique position provides visitors with stunning natural landscapes and opportunities to experience phenomena like the midnight sun and northern lights. The park is bordered by <strong>Torneträsk Lake</strong> to the east, offering scenic views and water-based activities, while rugged mountainous terrain defines its other boundaries.</p> 
          <p>Visitors to Abisko National Park can enjoy a range of recreational activities, including <strong>hiking</strong>, <strong>birdwatching</strong>, and <strong>northern lights viewing</strong>. Gathering <strong>edible mushrooms and berries</strong> and using motorboats on Torneträsk Lake are also permitted. <strong>Dogs</strong> are allowed on a leash during specific times of the year and on designated trails. However, to protect the park's delicate ecosystem, certain restrictions are in place. <strong>Camping</strong> is limited to designated sites, and fires are only allowed in specified areas with outdoor stoves. Activities like <strong>fishing</strong>, <strong>hunting</strong>, and <strong>disturbing wildlife</strong> are strictly prohibited, as is the use of drones and off-road vehicles. Additionally, the <strong>Ábeskoeatnus delta bird sanctuary</strong> is closed from <strong>May 1 to July 31</strong> to protect nesting birds, and visitors are required to avoid disturbing <strong>grazing reindeer</strong> or interfering with herding practices. These guidelines ensure that Abisko remains a pristine environment for both wildlife and future visitors.</p>

          <h3 class="text-center">Abisko's Flora and Fauna</h3>
          <p>Abisko National Park is home to a diverse array of wildlife and plant life, set against a unique geological backdrop. Predators like bears, wolverines, and lynx roam the park, though they are elusive, leaving tracks visible in the winter snow. Moose are common in winter due to the relatively shallow snow, and reindeer can be spotted year-round. Birdlife is abundant, with golden eagles, white-tailed eagles, and other raptors soaring above, while various songbirds and wading birds inhabit the birch forests, alpine heaths, and marshlands.</p>
          <p>The park's rich flore thrives in areas like Mount Njulla, known as "the flower mountain" for its diverse alpine plants, supported by limestone-rich soil and favorable sun exposure. Geologically, Abisko is defined by its mountain bedrock and dramatic landscapes shaped by ancient ice sheets, with the Abiskojakka river carving through the valley and forming steep canyon walls of schist and dolomite limestone.</p>
