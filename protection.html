          <br>

          <p>Abisko National Park is managed by the Norrbotten County Administrative Board, which oversees its conservation and daily operations (<a href="https://www.naturvardsverket.se/en/topics/protected-areas/different-types-of-nature-conservation/national-parks-in-sweden/">National parks in Sweden</a>, Naturvårdsverket and <a href="https://www.lansstyrelsen.se/english/about-us/the-county-administrative-board.html">The County Administrative Board</a>, Länsstyrelserna). The board is responsible for enforcing conservation policies, maintaining park infrastructure, and supporting scientific research. Management efforts are funded by the Swedish government, with resources allocated through the County Administrative Board and national conservation programs (<a href="https://www.naturvardsverket.se/en/topics/protected-areas/different-types-of-nature-conservation/national-parks-in-sweden/">National parks in Sweden</a> and <a href="https://www.naturvardsverket.se/en/international/research/the-environmental-research-fund/">The environmental research fund</a>, Naturvårdsverket).</p>
          <p>To address specific challenges, the park implements targeted strategies. Sustainable tourism practices are promoted to minimize environmental impact, ensuring that growing visitor numbers do not compromise the park’s delicate ecosystems (<a href="https://www.naturvardsverket.se/en/topics/the-right-of-public-access/">The Right of Public Access</a>, Naturvårdsverket and <a href="https://www.lansstyrelsen.se/english/nature-and-rural-areas/protected-nature.html">Protected nature</a>, Naturvårdsverket). The Abisko Scientific Research Station plays a crucial role in monitoring and addressing the effects of climate change, which poses a significant threat to the park’s biodiversity. Additionally, efforts are made to preserve Sami cultural sites and support traditional reindeer herding, maintaining the park’s cultural heritage alongside its natural beauty.</p>

          <br>

          <p>Abisko National Park was established in 1909 under Sweden's first Nature Conservation Act, which aimed to protect natural areas while promoting scientific research. This groundbreaking legislation laid the foundation for the park's mission to preserve its unique Arctic landscapes and biodiversity (<a href="https://visitabisko.com/about-abisko/abisko-national-park/">Abisko National Park</a>, Visit Abisko and <a href="https://www.environmentandsociety.org/tools/keywords/first-national-parks-sweden">First national parks in Sweden</a>, Environment & Society). In addition to its ecological significance, the park safeguards important Sami cultural sites, including ancient reindeer traps, hearths, and hut remains, offering a glimpse into the region's rich indigenous history (<a href="https://www.sverigesnationalparker.se/en/choose-park---list/abisko-national-park/national-park-facts/history/">Abisko National Park: History</a>, Sveriges Nationalparker).</p>
          <p>Today, the park faces several management challenges. Climate change poses a significant threat, altering ecosystems and impacting both plant and animal species. Additionally, the growing popularity of Abisko as a tourist destination presents a delicate balance between accommodating visitors and maintaining the park's pristine environment. Effective management strategies are crucial to address these issues while ensuring that both the natural and cultural heritage of Abisko are preserved for future generations (<a href="https://national-parks.org/sweden/abisko#protections">Abisko National Park: Park Protection</a>, National Parks).</p>

          <h2 class="text-center">Note on Climate Change</h2>

          <br>

          <p>As noted in TRAL 357, climate change is a global concern. Direct threats include changes in air temperature, rising sea levels, shifts in precipitation patterns, and extreme weather events. All of these can negatively impact both the species living in an environment and the environment itself. I wanted to highlight this topic because Abisko National Park lies in the Arctic, a region highly susceptible to the effects of climate change. At the same time, Abisko National Park presents a unique opportunity to contribute to climate change research, given the importance of the Abisko Research Station and its close proximity to the park.</p>
          <p>It is crucial to consider using specific, well-established frameworks such as RAD: resist, which means maintaining or restoring historical or current conditions; accept, which allows change to occur without intervention; and direct, which involves actively working to shift toward preferred new conditions. While my research found evidence that Sweden's national parks follow specific guidelines and regulations, I did not find detailed information about the specific climate change policies currently in place (<a href="https://canvas.oregonstate.edu/courses/1980240/pages/week-8-learning-materials-thur?module_item_id=24724651">Climate Change & PPAs</a>, TRAL 357).</p>
